h1. Site Structure Analyzer 

Webspider (anemone) with a Rails analysis app on top.

h2. Usage

* Edit your database.yml and *config/spider.yml*
* bundle install
* migrate
* rake spider:start
* Wait a night
* rake spider:refresh
** Will refresh the cached count columns for every page. This is necessary for sorting and displaying of links and backlinks count in the overview
* open localhost:3000/pages


*Tested* with ruby 1.8.7 only!


When you like to crawl again or a new page clear out the database before (TODO):

<pre>
  rake spider:clear
  rake spider:start
</pre>

Using the unix tool "screen" is very nice for not having to run my client machine all the time while crawling on a different machine btw.

h2. TODO

* i18n
* more filtering options
* support multiple domains (up to now, you can specify one in the config/spider.yml and have to clear out everything
* Speed of Crawling... ideas? anyone? threading seems not to work
* ...
